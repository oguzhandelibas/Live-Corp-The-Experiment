  AudioText:
  - Good morning, Subject U68. You are on the last day of the Live Corp tests. The
    promised payment will be transferred to your account at the end of the day.
  - Thank you for choosing to join our program.
  - Please use the portal in your room to stabilize your chip before starting today's
    portal experiments.
  - Find the box in your room for controlling your psychic powers, lift it up in
    the air, and then drop it to the ground.
  - The next portal is ready. When you feel ready, please proceed to the next room.
  - U68's heart rate is stable. There is no irregularity in breathing. Sleep pattern
    is normal. We will now begin today's measurements with a memory test.
  - We will compare the results of this memory test with the previous ones. Meanwhile,
    we will be observing the intensity of brain activity.
  - 'The rules are the same as last time: Specific squares will flash on and off.
    We want you to press the squares in the order of their illumination.'
  - You have successfully completed it. I want you to go through the portal one more
    time. Then we will conduct another test for a status check. Now, please proceed
    to the next experiment.
  - The next portal is ready. When you feel ready, please proceed to the next room.
  - U68, there is currently no task for you there. Please return to the beginning
    of the experiment immediately.
  - It seems like you don't want your money. The portal is waiting for you outside.
  - In the next experiment... I believe something is going wrong.
  - One of our maintenance robots has malfunctioned, U68. We need you to dispose
    of the robot to prevent any further issues.
  - This will be an additional experiment that will allow us to gather more detailed
    data on your muscular system and reflexes.
  - Therefore, we will make an additional payment to your fee. You are free to make
    a choice. Do you accept?
  - I'm glad you made the right choice.
  - Now I want you to pick up the weapon on the platform. We don't want the robot
    to harm you.
  - We might experience communication issues inside, but don't worry, you will be
    monitored by cameras. Don't get distracted under any circumstances!
  - We apologize, U68, but you now know too much. We cannot continue this experiment
    in this manner.
  - I told you not to get distracted. What are you still waiting for?
  - Attention all units! Subject U68 has escaped from the route.
  - It will be terminated on sight. Other subjects should not leave their rooms.
